### Deliverables

#### Edge Delivery Content APIs

A TypeScript serverless function hosted on Cloudflare Workers serves as the API endpoint for retrieving decrypted content (JSON, images, videos).

Authentication: Include access token via `Authorization` header or `access_token` query parameter.

Access tokens are generated in the APIs tab of each space in the Geist web app.

#### Astro Static Blog Demo

A demo blog site built with astro using inline loader to load contents delivered by edge delivery content APIs.
