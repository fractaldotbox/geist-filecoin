# Copilot Instructions for geist-filecoin

## Development Server

To start the development server, always use:

```bash
env-cmd pnpm dev
```

**Do not use** `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev` directly, as this project requires environment variables to be loaded properly via `env-cmd`.

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo with multiple packages:
- `packages/web/` - React frontend application
- `packages/auth/` - Authentication and policy engine
- `packages/storage/` - Storage provider integrations (Storacha)
- `packages/domain/` - Domain models and types
- `packages/cf-worker/` - Cloudflare Worker for API and sync

## Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **State Management**: LiveStore for real-time data synchronization
- **Storage**: Storacha (IPFS/Filecoin) for decentralized file storage
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **UI**: shadcn/ui components

## Content Management Flow

1. **Content Types**: Define schemas for different content types (blog, product, etc.)
2. **Entry Creation**: Users select a content type and fill out dynamically generated forms
3. **File Upload**: Files are uploaded to Storacha using delegated tokens
4. **Storage**: Entry data and file metadata are stored in LiveStore

## Common Commands

- Start dev server: `env-cmd pnpm dev`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Test: `pnpm test`
- Lint: `pnpm lint`

## Environment Setup

Make sure to copy `env.sample` to `.env` and configure the required environment variables before running the development server.
